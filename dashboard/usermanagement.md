### Create a user

By default, the only available user after installing the dashboard is the user that installed it, this user is an admin.

Click on the "Add User" button.

Specify all the user information + user role (System Admin or Non Admin). The difference between them is that System Admin can do everything. From adding a user, deleting a user, adding flows, adding folders, edit flows etc... For Non Admin, the difference is that he cannot add users, delete users. He will be a normal user but then he can be a Folder Admin for a specific folder. We will go into more detail regarding the Folder Permissions in another documentation.
