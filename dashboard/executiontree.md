# Dashboard Execution Tree

The Execution Tree or also commonly referred to as the "Clickthrough" corresponds to the detail of the execution followed by certain flow, which corresponds to all the executed Logic Apps inside the flow. 

To see the execution tree, choose any message and click on the blue icon to the left.

![execution tree](../images/dsb-executiontree.gif)

Within this view it is also possible:

* To see if a certain logic app execution was either successful, failed or was resumed/resubmitted (1).
* To see the tracked properties, errors on on logic app level and to navigate to the Azure portal (2). See Business audit trail for more details.

In this example, the first two logic apps (in red) were resubmitted and ended in error.  Opossite to the last two child logic apps (in black) which completed succesfully.

## Business Audit Trail

For every logic app executed inside a flow, it is possible to see its business tracked properties.  The following information is available for business users to easily track flow execution and data on the execution tree level.

### Milestone and Event Text

Milestone and EventText are properties set and displayed by default, they do not need to be set from the dashboard during the creation of a flow. For EventText if the value re-appears in several logic apps, instead of overwriting/updating its value, all data is appended as a single value, separated by comma.

### Message Content View

The message content view allows the user to track the outputs and inputs of an action. The image below shows an example of the input and output of an action being tracked. These are visible per LogicApp in the Clickthrough(execution tree) table. 

**The flowhandlerjob needs Logic Apps Contributor rights on the resource group where the logic app is located.**

The links in the above image are the friendly names set in the tracked properties of the "tracked" action. Once any of the above names is clicked a new tab will open with the content of either the input or the output.

**To track the input and output of an action in a logicapp the below tracked properties have to be set in an action.**

|Property Name|Required|Sample Value|Description|
| --- | :---: | --- | --- |
|x-iv-messagecontent-input-name|Yes(if the input content type is present)|ActionInput|This is the friendly name displayed in the ClickThrough/ExecutionTree, the value can be anything you like. The value has to be a single word|
|x-iv-messagecontent-input-content-type|Yes(if the input name is present)|application/json|This should have the same content type as the data type when opening the input link for an action|
|x-iv-messagecontent-output-name|Yes(if the output content type is present)|ActionOutput|This is the friendly name displayed in the ClickThrough/ExecutionTree, the value can be anything you like. The value has to be a single word|
|x-iv-messagecontent-output-content-type|Yes(if the output name is present)|application/json|This should have the same content type as the data type when opening the input link for an action|

Please not that you can have one or the other, or both active, you do not need to have both input and output setup. The only requirment is that if the "-name" is present then the "-content-type" has to be also present for the desired output.

### Tracked Properties

To see the tracked properties on execution tree level, click on the "Details" link. A popup opens showing all the tracked properties available on every logic app inside the flow.

> Please note that search capabilities do not apply to this feature.

### Errors on Logic App level

In the same popup that now displays the tracked properties on execution tree level,  it is possible to see the error description when an exception has ocurred on logic app level.

And for additional details and follow up on technical errors,  the link to navigate to Azure Portal can be used.
