The dashboard will show you an overview of the status of all your flows. For each flow you will be able to see the status of the received messages.

A message can have the following status:

* **Active** - Shows all messages which are currently being processed.
* **Completed** - Shows all messages that are completed (processed successfully).
* **Error** - Shows all messages that are suspended, dehydrated or terminated.
