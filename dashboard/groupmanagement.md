# Group Permission Management



## Setup App Registration on Microsoft Azure

Create a new App Registration:

![folder1](../images/dashboard/groupman_1.png)


Register a new Application:

![folder1](../images/dashboard/groupman_2.png)


Once registered, an overview of the application with all keys and ids will be displayed.
These keys are required to be added in the configuration for Invictus later on:

![folder1](../images/dashboard/groupman_3.png)


Setup the Redirect URIs according to the application address by adding:
```
-	{url-to-app}/login?returnUrl=%2Fdashboard%2Fsettings
-	{url-to-app}/login?returnUrl=%2Fdashboard%2Foverview
```

Setup Redirect URIs in the Authentication tab:
