# Role Management

There are four roles to control the user access to folders and flows and perform certain tasks whithin the dashboard:

### System Admin
Automatically has all rights and access to all flows and folders, users with this role can also manage users and grant/deny access on folder level to other users. This role is assigned from the user management page on the Dashboard when either adding or editing a user by indicating if such user is System Admin or not. When a user is not System Admin, the user will be assigned the role and permissions on folder level. 

### Folder Admin
Does not have access to any folder/flow by default. This role is assigned to users on folder level by a System Admin user by selecting the users that will have Folder Admin privileges. This role can perform certain administrative tasks only within the folder where he/she is assigned to, and cannot manage users on the dashboard in general. 

### Operator
