# Dashboard

Invictus™ Integration Dashboard is a web-based management tool allowing functional key users to monitor and manage integration processes. The Dashboard makes your integration platform and business processes manageable for all users, turning the black box of your integrations into a transparent environment.

Invictus™ Integration Dashboard is designed so that other integration solutions can publish information to the Dashboard. This is important in hybrid architectures and of great value to any organization that relies on Microsoft BizTalk and Logic Apps.
