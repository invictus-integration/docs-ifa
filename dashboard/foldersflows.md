# Dashboard Folders and Flows

## Structure

The functional structure of the dashboard is like a directory structure containing folders & flows

### Folder

A folder is a collection/hierarchy of flows. Each folder can contain an unlimited number of flows.

### Subfolder

Inside each folder, the user can create multiple subfolders which can can contain an unlimited number of flows. A subfolder may also host other subfolders to further subdivide your directory structure.

### Flows

Flows (= message chain) are an aggregation of all the messages that can be linked to the same incoming message. Flows are the functional representation of the message with an optional context property name and / or optional context property value. Flows have a number of predefined properties which you are interested in that are shown in the results grid.

### Tree Structure

For this setting to apply, the Connected Dashboard needs to be enabled by your Admin through the settings page of the dashboard in order to switch on this feature.
  * Show milestone and event text: Checking this option will enable the flow milestone and event text data to be displayed.
  * Custom resubmit/resume URLs: Check these options and provide the necessary URLs to use your own resume and resubmit logic.
* **Folder**: attach a flow to a specific folder
