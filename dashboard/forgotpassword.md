# Forgot Password

**Before you can use the forgot password, you need to create an email address with an open permission to apps. Like for example gmail, you can set it on for any app to use the account you are creating for the forgot password. This will give Invictus Dashboard access to use the email as a "sender" email.**

**When you create your email address you need to set it up in the dashboard.**

## Setting up the email details

First you need a system admin account to login in the dashboard and from the settings page you can find a new form with the details you need to fill in.

In here, you need to enter the host for example "smpt.gmail.com" if it's for a gmail email account. The port number, which by default is 587. The email api key and password api key is the key of the keyvault from which you need to retrieve the email address and password of the forgot password email you are going to send from. The last thing is if it's ssl enabled or not. It's better to use enable ssl as the major email providers need this as to be checked. You can proceed by clicking the save button and you are done.
