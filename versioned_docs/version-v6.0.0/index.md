## What is Invictus for Azure?
**Invictus for Azure** is a smart business monitoring system designed by [Codit](https://codit.eu) to better control and overview your integrations. Commonly used with Azure Logic App workflows, but the system also supports a wide range of other integration types.

Invictus consists of two parts:
* An on-premises **Dashboard** that reduces the need for in-depth Azure knowledge and allows business users to focus on the status of their integrations.
* A set of **Framework** components that supports commonly used integration patterns in Azure Logic App workflows.

## Why should we use Invictus for Azure?
Without **Invictus for Azure**, business users need direct access to the Azure portal to manage their integrations. This requires both in-depth Azure knowledge and elevated permissions.

**Invictus for Azure** introduces a user-friendly layer that separates business operations from underlying Azure technology, improving productivity, security, and reliability.
