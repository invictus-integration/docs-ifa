# Manage Users in the Dashboard
The Invictus Dashboard allows you to access the application with multiple user accounts. These can be local users, managed by Invictus itself; or **Active Directory** users, managed by your Azure tenant.

> üéñÔ∏è We recommend using **Active Directory** users over local users for security reasons.

![users overview](/images/v2_users1.png)

<Tabs groupId="user-source">
<TabItem value="ad" label="Active Directory" default>

> üë§ Requires membership of a synced Active Directory group

The Invictus Dashboard can be configured to [use existing users in Azure Active Directory groups](../installation/01_give_ad_access.md). This removes the need to work with additional local Dashboard users.

### Add an Active Directory user to the Dashboard
Azure Active Directory users can sign in automatically into the Invictus Dashboard if that user is part of an Active Directory group that is [synced into the Dashboard](../installation/02_sync_ad_groups.md).

> ‚òùÔ∏è Make sure that the group has a [role assigned](./03_roles.md), otherwise the Dashboard will be unusable for the user.

### Delete an Active Directory user from the Dashboard
> üë§ Requires group membership with `System admin` role to delete users

1. To delete a user click on the delete icon next to the user in the user list. Confirm your decision in the confirmation box.
  ![delete azure user](/images/delete-azure-user.PNG)
    > üëÄ Linked Active Directory users can be distinguished as they do not have a personal role assigned. The role is determined by the group the user is a member of.

### Edit an Active Directory user's role in the Dashboard
Active Directory users don't have personalized roles that allow them to access certain flows in the Dashboard. The user role is determined by the Active Directory group(s) where the user is a member of. [If the group(s) has access to the flow](../installation/02_sync_ad_groups.md), so will the user.

### Forgot Password
Before you can use the forgot password feature, you need to create an Azure Active Directory application registration and set it up with the Mail.Send API permissions. This is required because emails can only be sent through an OAuth 2.0 flow. Previously, emails were sent using an SMTP client with a username, password, and SMTP connection. However, Microsoft and Google no longer allow this and are deprecating this service.

Please note that the permission granted allows any email address within the organization to be used as the sender.

To set up the Azure Active Directory application registration with the Mail.Send API permission, please follow the instructions [here](../installation/01_give_ad_access.md).

## Setup Email Address as the Sender
