# Roles

## Available flow permissions
The following table describes what flow-related functionality is permitted for users, based on the set role they receive on a folder: *Reader*, *Operator* or *Folder admin*. Both single **local users** as well as **groups** can be assigned to folders.

:::info[System admins]
Users with the *System admin* user role (either as a local user or via a member of a group with such role) benefit from the same permissions as the *Folder admin* permission on <u>all</u> flows in the Dashboard -- regardless whether the *System admin* user was assigned to the folder or not.

## Available user roles
The following table describes what non-flow related parts of the Dashboard are available for users, based on their assigned roles: *Non-admin* and *System admin*. Active Directory users receive their role based on the role of the group that they are a member of. Local users receive personalized roles for each one separately.
