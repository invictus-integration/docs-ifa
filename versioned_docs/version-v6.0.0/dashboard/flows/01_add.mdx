# Add new flows
Each [folder](./index.md#organizing-flows-in-folders) can hold one or more 'flows'. These are message chains, an aggregation of all the messages that can be linked to the same incoming message. Flows are the functional representation of the message with an optional context property name and / or optional context property value.

| Flow property                           | Required | Description |
| --------------------------------------- | :------: | ----------- |
| <span class="no-wrap"><span class="flow-add-number">1</span> **Flow Name**</span> | yes | A case sensitive name that describe the client interaction (example: ex. invoice request, invoice approval, …) |
| <span class="no-wrap"><span class="flow-add-number">2</span> **Folder**</span> | yes | The location of where to save the flow. Flows are always structured in folders. |
| <span class="no-wrap"><span class="flow-add-number">3</span> **Mapping**</span> | no | The mapping that is used to 'map' flow traces to this flow. The DSAV mapping are special business properties that are treated differently during flow trace importing, loaded from 'tracked properties, for instance, when using [importing them via Logic Apps](./04_import-flow-traces/import-flows-via-la.mdx).). A dedicated `WorkflowName` is added in those cases as well to map the flow traces of the Logic App workflow more easily to the flow. |
| <span class="no-wrap"><span class="flow-add-number">4</span> **Business Properties**</span> | no | Additional properties to describe the flow. These are only here to provide metadata and are not used in the flow tracing. |
| <span class="no-wrap"><span class="flow-add-number">5</span> **Advanced Settings**</span> | no | <ul><li>*Connected Dashboard:* if the flow has multiple Dashboards and it needs to connect to another Dashboard then this needs to be checked.  For this setting to apply, the Connected Dashboard needs to be enabled by your Admin through the settings page of the Dashboard in order to switch on this feature.</li><li>*Show milestone and event text:* Checking this option will enable the flow milestone and event text data to be displayed.</li><li>*Custom resubmit/resume URLs:* Check these options and provide the necessary URLs to use [your own resume and resubmit logic](./04_import-flow-traces/import-flows-via-la.mdx).</li></ul> |

## Permissions
To allow only certain users/groups to access the flows, you can assign permissions to the folder where the flow is located ([available roles](../security/03_roles.md)). System admins are automatically assigned to every folder available.

## Alerting
:::warning
To manage alerts within Flows, make sure the [necessary **role assignments** are set](../installation/03_give_la_access.md) in your Invictus installation.

      <td>
      This value is used to select which type of query the alert rule will have `AzureResultCount`/`InvictusActivityCheck`/`InvictusErrorCheck` - AzureResultCount lets the user enter custom script which is accepted by the Azure Rule Syntax. The ones starting with `Invictus...` are pre-made scripts for the user to select without having to modify.
    <details>
      <summary>*Invictus Activity Check*</summary>

This query type will filter logs on Azure Logs by the `InvictusImportJobFlowActivityAlert` property. The backend will log activity for any flows that are active every hour. An example of how the alert settings for this flow could be set:
      <ul>
        <li>Frequency: 60</li>
        <li>Time Window: 60</li>
        <li>Trigger Threshold Operator: LessThan</li>
        <li>Threshold: 0</li>
      </ul>
      This will create a rule to run every 60 minutes, scans the logs for the last 60 minutes and if the returned value is less than the threshold, it means that the flow is inactive, thus triggers the alert on Azure.
      :::note
      Please note that the backend will not increment the activity for each message that is processed for a flow. This simply sends a single log per hour for each flow that is active, the count might be higher than one per hour due to scaling situations and multi-threaded scenarios. The logging frequency for the backend can be increased by reducing the following value: <strong>FlowActivityIntervalInMinutes</strong>. This can be passed to the Bicep template during deployment.
      :::
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>*Invictus Error Check*</summary>

This query type will filter logs on Azure Logs by the "InvictusImportJobFlowErrorAlert" property. The backend will log a message for each Flow that triggers an error. An example of how the alert settings for this flow could be set:
        * Frequency: 10
        * Time Window: 10
        * Trigger Threshold Operator: GreaterThan
        * Threshold: 0
      This will create a rule to run every 10 minutes, scans the logs for the last 10 minutes and if the returned value is greater than the threshold, it means that the flow has failed messages, thus triggers the alert on Azure.
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>*AzureResultCount*</summary>
      
This will enable custom scripts with the Azure Alert syntax. If you require further information about this type of syntax please refer to the official documentation by Microsoft.
