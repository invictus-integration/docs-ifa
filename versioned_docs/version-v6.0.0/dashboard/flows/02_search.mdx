# Search for flow traces
The Dashboard allows business users to search for flow traces for a single or multiple flows during defect localization or verification of client integrations. The `[Select Flows]` dropdown provides you to select one or more flows for which the search query should take place.

Additionally, the Dashboard provides *Basic* and *Advanced* search capabilities to deepen the search.

<Tabs groupId="search-type">
<TabItem value="basic" label="Basic search" default>
The user is able to perform a basic text search through the top search bar.

![Basic search example](/images/dashboard/search-for-flow-traces-basic-search.gif)

This will search (case-insensitive) through these properties of the flow trace.

| Flow trace property | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| **Chain ID**        | Shows only the flow traces within the same transaction, linked together with the Chain ID, also known in Azure Logic Apps as the 'client tracking ID'. |
| **DSAV**            | Shows only flow traces with the same mapping: Domain, Service, Action, Version. (These are special business properties that are treated differently during flow trace importing, loaded from 'tracked properties, for instance, when using [importing them via Logic Apps](./04_import-flow-traces/import-flows-via-la.mdx).) |

Click the `[Search]` button or press `[Enter]` to perform your query.

<TabItem value="advanced" label="Advanced search">
An additional set of filters are available when clicking open the **Advanced Search** pane to further subset the flow traces search query. 

![Advanced search example](/images/dashboard/search-for-flow-traces-advanced-search.gif)

The following filters may be applied:

| Filter parameter | Required | Description | 
| ---------------- | :------: | ----------- |
| **Date filter**  | yes      | Shows only the flow traces within a given time frame. Possible options are: <ul><li>`all` (= last 30 days)</li><li>`after [your date]`</li><li>`before [your date]`</li><li>`between [your start date] and [your end date]`</li><li>`last [your amount] [minutes\|hours\|days\|weeks\|months]`</li></ul> |
| **Chain ID**     | no       | Shows only the flow traces within the same transaction, linked together with the Chain ID, also known in Azure Logic Apps as the 'client tracking ID'. |
| **Status**       | no       | Shows only the flow traces at a given state: <ul><li>`Active`: being processed, ([including resubmit & resume for Logic Apps](./04_import-flow-traces/import-flows-via-la.mdx))</li><li>`Completed`: successfully finished processing.</li><li>`Error`: failure during processing ([including Logic Apps failures](./04_import-flow-traces/import-flows-via-la.mdx))</li><li>`Ignored`: [when importing via LogicApps](./04_import-flow-traces/import-flows-via-la.mdx), flows that were ignored.</li></ul> | 
| **DSAV**         | no       | Shows only flow traces with the same mapping: Domain, Service, Action, Version. (These are special business properties that are treated differently during flow trace importing, loaded from 'tracked properties, for instance, when using [importing them via Logic Apps](./04_import-flow-traces/import-flows-via-la.mdx).) <br/> An extra `Contains Word` option is available to also include partial matches of these mappings. |
| **Properties**   | no       | Shows only flow traces that has certain custom user properties defined. The property value can be filtered in using a format: <ul><li>`Equal`: exact matches are included.</li><li>`Not Equal`: differences are included</li><li>`Starts With`: matching prefix are included</li><li>`Ends With`: matching postfix are included</li><li>`Contains`: partial matches are included.</li><li>`Regex`: matching patterns are included ([regular expression language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference))</li></ul> |
