# Framework

The Invictus Integration Framework turns integration development into configuration.  It processes millions of messages every single day in customer solutions worldwide.  The time needed for development, testing and the overall risk for an integration solution is reduced when using the framework.

When implementing the framework in your integration you will achieve a high level of consistency, generating an immediate positive impact on the Total Cost of Ownership of your integration solution. It allows you to build your mission critical integration solution on robust, production proven and supported components.
