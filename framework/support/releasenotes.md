### Important to know before you apply this new release

1. Builds need to be updated since a new Powershell file has been added, DataFactoryTriggerHandler.ps1. Build documentation has been updated for Backend, Framework and Dashboard
2. Task groups have been updated, Release documentation has been updated for Backend, Framework and Dashboard
3. Before releasing, switch off the function ending with "-invictusimportjob" for 5 minutes. This is required since the ClickThroughJob will be removed from the next release and if any data is already in the queue we need to let it process first
4. Login to the Dashboard after releasing its latest version and before switching on the "-invictusimportjob"  function
5. After the release is complete and you have already logged in to the dashboard, delete the function ending with "-clickthroughjob"

Step 3 & 4 are only required for existing installations. New installation do not require this step.

Please be aware that these packages will include the Cleanup Job, refer to the ARM settings below for the default values. You can override these settings from your release pipeline in DevOps.

> DataCleanup: Will run every hour, deleting data older than 90 days for all flow tables.

* cleanupJobIntervalInMinutes: 60
* dataCleanupMaxRetentionDays: 90
* dataCleanupMaxProcessingRows: 5000

> ReIndex: Will ReIndex all tables at 2am and will repeat every 24hrs

* reIndexStartTime: 2019-05-30T02:00:00.000Z
