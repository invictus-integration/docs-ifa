# Invictus Framework VNET Support

Enabling Azure Virtual Network support for the Invictus Framework is an identical process as for the Invictus Dashboard. Therefore you can follow the same guide found [here](../../dashboard/installation/dashboard-vnet.md).

A full list of VNET specific parameters which can be passed to Framework release pipeline can be found [here](framework-releasepipeline.md).
